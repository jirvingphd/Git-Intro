    "While the focus of this lesson is git, their will inevitably be spill over from day 1 and section 1. Try and focus student's attention on the must haves for git at this point: Forking and Cloning. Many students may still be grappling with basic python so while introducing bash and git is needed to get them up and running, too many diverse ideas such as branching, merging and stashing may overwhelm them. \n",

    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Git and Github effectively\n",
    "- Fork and clone a repo from GitHub\n",
    "- Be able to git add\n",
    "- Be able to git commit with meaningful commit messages\n",
    "- Be able to git push\n",
    "- Be able to git pull down changes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisite Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "* Basic Computer Literacy\n",
    "* Command line familiarity is very helpful but not 100% essential (pwd, cd, ls, etc.)\n",
